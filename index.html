        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The challenge was to build a personal portfolio website that showcases
          my skills, background, and achievements. My portfolio is designed to
          include details about the programming languages I am proficient in as
          well as a brief introduction about myself, my passion for technology,
          and what drives me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Programming Languages:</strong> I am proficient in Python,
          HTML, Git and Github and have a basic understanding of C++. I also
          have experience using MySQL for database management.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there! My name is George Chelal Chementer, and I am a
          23-year-old Kenyan with a deep-rooted passion for technology. From a
          young age, I found myself fascinated by how gadgets and computers
          work, which led me to experiment with different tech-related projects.
          Over the years, I've attended workshops, online courses, and
          hackathons to broaden my skill set beyond the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey has been filled with challenges and successes that have
          shaped my understanding of the tech world. Whether it's tinkering with
          electronics, learning a new programming language, or simply staying
          up-to-date with the latest trends, I always strive to push my
          boundaries and learn something new every day. This curiosity drives me
          forward, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          My educational journey began at Carmelvale Catholic Primary School,
          where I studied for eight years and completed my primary education in
          2015. During this time, I not only developed strong foundational
          skills but also discovered my growing interest in science and
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          After primary school, I joined Sunshine Secondary School from 2016 to
          2019. Here, I had the opportunity to participate in various clubs and
          competitions that further fueled my passion for electronics and
          innovation. I particularly enjoyed science fairs and coding clubs,
          where I collaborated with like-minded peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering at the
          University of Nairobi. This program allows me to delve deeper into the
          world of circuits, power systems, and embedded technology. I am
          constantly amazed by the synergy between hardware and software, and I
          hope to use my education to create impactful solutions that bridge
          these two domains.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My primary area of interest lies in app development, which perfectly
          complements my background in Electrical Engineering. I believe that
          the future of innovation lies in integrating advanced electronics with
          powerful, user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it's developing mobile apps to control home automation systems
          or creating custom software for specialized hardware, I'm always on
          the lookout for ways to bring my electronic creations to life through
          intuitive interfaces. My goal is to build electronics that seamlessly
          work with apps, delivering cutting-edge solutions to real-world
          problems.
